Supervised by Prof. Chang Xu, I implemented a C-like language complier with C language. It was divided into four phases: lexical and syntax analysis (using Flex and Bison), semantic analysis, intermediate code generation and object code (MIPS32 assembly) generation. Additonally, I optimized number of codes generated during the last two phases.
